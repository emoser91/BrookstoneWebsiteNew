                <p class="answer">Uncoated stock paper is comparatively porous and inexpensive, and is typically used for such applications as 
                    interactive workbook print and basic black-and-white copying. Coated stock, by contrast, is made of higher quality paper 
                    having a smooth glossy finish that works well for reproducing sharp text and vivid colors. </p>

                <p class="answer">The basis weight of a given grade of paper is defined as the weight (in pounds) of 500 standard-sized sheets of that paper. With that in mind, here are different examples of paper grades and their respective basis weights:
                    Coated Book: Has a glossy finish that yields vivid colors and overall excellent reproduction. Basis weights range from 60# to 110# for sheetfed press.
                    Cover: Used in creating business cards, postcards and book covers. Can be either coated or uncoated. Basis weights for this grade are 80#, 100# or thicker.
                    Uncoated Book: The most common grade for offset printing. Typically 50# to 70#.
                    Bond: Most commonly used for letterhead, business forms and copying. Typical basis weights are 16# for forms, 20# for copying and 24# for stationery.</p>

                    4/4 refers to full color printing on both sides. The combination of these four colors can produce a wide array of colors.
                    1/0 refers to one color printing on one side and no printing on the back of the sheet.

                </div>
                <p class="answer">Saddle stitched books are folded in half and bound in the center of the sheet. Each individual sheet has 2 pages 
                    of the book on both sides, making 4 pages total per sheet of paper. We cannot add half a sheet of paper into the book because 
                    that sheet would not be bound into the book.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="answer">Pantone colors refer to the Pantone Matching System (PMS), a color matching system used by the 
                    printing industry whereby printing colors are identified by a unique name or number (as opposed to just a visual reference). 
                    This helps make sure that colors turn out the same from system to system, and print run to print run.  The use of PMS allows 
                    us to precisely match colors and maintain color consistency throughout the printing process.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="answer">Yes. The primary coating choices are varnishes, aqueous coatings and UV coatings. Each coating has its 
                    advantages and disadvantages and choosing which one is right for you largely depends on what you are printing as well 
                    as what type of paper you are printing on.  Contact one of our printing experts to help you choose the best coating for

                </div>
                <p class="answer">A PDF file (Portable Document Format) is generally the preferred file format for submitting a document 
                    for printing as it works with virtually all professional printing and digital output devices. By design, a PDF file 
                    incorporates the information needed to maintain document consistency from system to system. Most other file formats 
                    such as Adobe InDesign, Illustrator and Microsoft Word are easily converted to PDF format.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="answer">All images should be 300 dpi.  DPI is the amount of ink dots per inch; 300 dots per inch is the 
                    standard for printed material. Anything below 200 dpi may not be good enough resolution for printing.  Pictures 
                    and graphics pulled from the internet are often low resolution, typically 72 dpi or 96 dpi. Avoid these graphics 
                    as they will appear pixelated and blocky when printed.  Also note that you should save all photos in CMYK mode, 
                    not RGB mode when possible. Images saved in RGB mode may not print properly. If you are unable to save your image 
                    in CYMK mode, please let us know.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="answer">Bleed is when the print area goes beyond the final trim line of the page thus allowing final 
                    print to “bleed” off the edge of the page. Recommended bleed is 1/8 inch (.125) on all sides of the page or

                </div>
                <p class="answer">In short, printers and monitors produce colors in different ways. Monitors use the RGB
                     (red, green, blue) color model, which usually supports a wider spectrum of colors. Printers use the 
                     CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) color model, which can reproduce most—but not all—of the colors in 
                     the RGB color model. Depending on the equipment used, CMYK generally matches 85–90% of the colors in the 
                     RGB model.</p>
